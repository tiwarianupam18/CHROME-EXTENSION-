# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :

As a task of CODTECH internship, I built a chrome extension . I aim to develop a Chrome extension that tracks user activity and displays a visual representation of the data using a pie chart. The extension comprises a manifest.json file for defining permissions and configurations, background.js for handling events in the background, and content.js for interacting with web pages. The popup interface is crafted with popup.html, popup.css, and popup.js to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The backend is built with Node.js, featuring app.js as the main entry point, routes such as logRoutes.js and userRoutes.js for managing API endpoints, and a MongoDB database configuration in database.js to store user activity logs securely. MongoDB is crucial for scalable and efficient data storage, ensuring that logs are persistently recorded and retrievable. The dashboard, which is the visual highlight of the project, is designed with index.html, style.css, and script.js to provide an intuitive and responsive user experience. The pie chart is created using libraries like Chart.js, offering clear and interactive data visualization. Implementing the UI for both the extension and dashboard has been rewarding, with a focus on aesthetics and usability to ensure a seamless experience for users. Some challenges include managing real-time synchronization between the extension, backend, and dashboard, as well as ensuring secure and efficient communication through API calls. Another challenge has been optimizing the MongoDB queries to handle large amounts of user data without affecting performance. Despite these challenges, the integration of MongoDB has been instrumental in building a robust and scalable system that can handle data growth effectively. In conclusion, this project leverages modern web technologies, including Chrome extension APIs, Node.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Chart.js for visualization, resulting in a feature-rich and visually compelling activity-tracking solution. This project exemplifies the seamless integration of multiple technologies to deliver a feature-rich and visually appealing Chrome extension. The activity-tracking capability combined with an intuitive pie chart visualization offers users a clear and immediate understanding of their usage patterns. The responsive and interactive user interface, designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensures a smooth and engaging experience for users. The popup component of the extension is particularly notable for its simplicity and elegance, enabling users to access their data quickly without unnecessary complexity. The use of Chart.js to render pie charts provides an interactive and visually stunning representation of the data, making it both informative and aesthetically pleasing. The dashboard further enhances the project by offering a comprehensive view of the tracked activity, complementing the extension with a more detailed and insightful analysis . The integration of real-time data tracking, efficient storage, and visually engaging analytics elevates user productivity. Its lightweight design, secure API handling, and polished UI create an exceptional and user-friendly experience In conclusion, this Chrome extension stands out as a sophisticated example of modern web development, seamlessly combining multiple technologies. The use of Chrome Extension APIs powers its core functionality, while Node.js provides a robust backend for handling data processing and API calls. MongoDB plays a crucial role in securely storing and managing user data, ensuring scalability for future growth. Chart.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together create a polished user experience and deliver a visually impactful solution.
